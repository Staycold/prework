So for the Module 8 acvtitiy, there were a lot of things wrong or missing.

I found that:   1)The colours for the buttons didn't match the colour effect. 
		2)The "Boo the dog heading was missing <h1></h1>.
		3)There were no clearly seperated paraghaphs in the About Boo section. 
		4)The link in the About Boo section was missing. ( A description is not a link)
		5)The Boo image was missing the <> around the img file.
		6)The Random Boo Facts were not seperated properly with ".
		7)The link to the js file was incorrect. Where logic.js should have been it was written errors.js ( hah)
		8)In the logic.js file the colour pink was missing quotes. 
		8)The list of Boo's favourite things wasn't idetified properly, was missing the <li></li>.
		10)The "quotes were missing on the click to make the box grow and shrink in the logic.js
		
		a)I commented out the instructions box.
		b)I fixed some of the spacing of the code to make it more legible.
		c)I added some comments in the js file to explain what certain things do.
